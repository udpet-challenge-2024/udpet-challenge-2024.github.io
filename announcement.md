# Ultra-Low Dose PET Imaging (UDPET) Challenge 2024

Dear participants of the Ultra-Low Dose PET Imaging (UDPET) Challenge,

We are thrilled to announce the continuation of the challenge with UDPET 2024. This year's challenge will incorporate a broader and more diverse dataset acquired on two commercial Total-Body PET systems, uExplorer (United Imaging) and Biograph Vision Quadra (Siemens Healthineers), to solidify the trust in methodological developments and enhance the clinical translational potential of the outcomes.

A comprehensive workshop will be held at IEEE MIC 2024 on October 29th. Participants ranked within the top 10 will be invited to present their work at the IEEE MIC 2024 Ultra-low-dose PET imaging workshop.
