# Ultra-Low Dose PET Imaging (UDPET) Challenge

Positron emission tomography (PET) in vivo visualizes the molecular pathway and is the most sensitive molecular imaging modality routinely applied in clinic. Ionization radiation burden is a major concern in the practice of PET imaging, which hampers the application in many situation. Recent development in PET dramatically increased the effective sensitivity by increasing the geometric coverage, which is confirmed to be able to reduce approximately 10 times radiation exposure. This encouraging breakthrough brings the hope of low statistics corresponding to low dose PET imaging equivalent to transatlantic flight with the assistance of advanced computational methods.

This challenge aims to develop computational algorithms capable of recovering high-quality imaging from low statistics corresponding to low dose scans, with the hope of reducing the radiation exposure to be equivalent to transatlantic flight.
